            Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet and our nearest planetary neighbor.
            <br />
            It has a surface hot enough to melt lead. Internally, Venus has a
            core, mantle, and crust. <br />
            Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced magnetosphere
            is caused by atmospheric interactions with the solar wind. <br />
            Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in
            resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. <br />
            Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being
            Mercury, that have no moons. <br />
            Conditions perhaps favourable for life on Venus have been identified
            at its cloud layers. Venus may have had liquid surface water early
            in its history with a habitable environment, <br />
            before a runaway greenhouse effect evaporated any water and turned
            Venus into its present state.

          <p>
            There have been over 40 total missions to Venus. The first
            spacecraft to visit any planet beyond Earth was NASA's Mariner 2
            when it flew past Venus on Dec. 14, 1962.

          <h3>Future Missions</h3>
          <p>
            NASA is planning two new missions to Venus: VERITAS, which will
            collect high-resolution, global maps of the hellish surface hidden
            beneath the clouds, and DAVINCI, which will study Venus from its
            clouds down to the planet's surface – the first mission to study
            Venus using both flybys and a descent probe..
